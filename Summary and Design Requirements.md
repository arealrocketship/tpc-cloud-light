# Cloud Light Summary and Design Requirements
## Summary:
Create a physical product similar to the “bat signal” and other devices enabling signaling from afar. 
We see other products on the market but none of these products offer the following features:
- Configurable for a larger group
- Offer dynamic light patterns using individually-addressable LEDs 
- Feature a customizable polymer-FDM cloud geometry
- Use a Telegram bot or Discord bot or website for controlling the lights
- Use Bluetooth for first time setup
---
## Final Product:
- Bot or website used to trigger the “signal”
- Easy instructions for set-up using Bluetooth 
- Hardware sign delivered to all friends with the following:
- Sign containing LEDs lights up in pre-specified patterns
- Button for user to perform action on LEDs or bot
- Switch for user to toggle entire system or LEDs on/off
- Auto-update capability from Github based on changes to scripts, etc
- All parts are easily mounted or hung on a wall or desk:
Cloud - stand or hanging hook as secondary print
Brain - hook or adhesive
---
## The Dream “Homey Receipt”:
- Mail day! User receives cloud light connected to brain
- 120V wall power supply
- User takes it out of the box and constructs stand or mounts item
- User plugs in power supply to barrel jack
- User uses Bluetooth app with instructions to configure wifi setup
- User is Telegram message the bot to turn the lights on

## Maintenance: 
- Remove front or side panel of brain
- Pull out the raspberry pi or the SD card
- Raspberry Pi seats in headers
- No maintenance on cloud
- If LEDS damaged or broken: User swaps entire cloud assembly with WAGO connectors
- No maintenance planned on other components
